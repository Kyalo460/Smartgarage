            Smart Garage is a website for booking garage appointments. 
            You can book an appointment to either get your car fixed or to get maintenance done on your car. 
            When registering, you get to provide your car's model; 
            this is important because it let's us know the type of car we'll be working with. 
            So be sure to provide the correct details when signing up.

        <h2>About:</h2>
        <h2>
            This is a portfolio project developed by <a class="links" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-kyalo-17a438243" target="_blank">Brian Kyalo</a> and 
            <a class="links" href="www.linkedin.com/in/caroline-kalumu" target="_blank">Caroline Kalumu </a>
             .It was an assignment issued at <a class="links" href="https://www.alxafrica.com/" target="_blank">ALX SE</a> (an online school for Software Engineering). We were
             given the freedom to choose the project that we would do and technologies that we were going to use. I (Brian Kyalo) was studying
             node js and express js on the side, so I convinced my partner to use those languages for the backend. This meant that 
             I would be the one tasked with coming up with the backend infrastracture. We were given three weeks to complete the project. I made
              the github repository and added my teammate as a collaborator and we scheduled google meetings for us to
               collaborate on the project. This project was an excitng journey filled with challenges and triumphs which led to us learning more
                about Software Engineering.
